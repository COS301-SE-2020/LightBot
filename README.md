# LightBot

# Adaptive Traffic Control Solution Enhanced with Artificial Intelligence

## Description

This repository contains an implementation of ['Lightbot'](lightbot.co.za) Artificial Intelligence Adaptive Traffic Control Solution. Lightbot is a software engineering project proposed by ['Fifth Dimension Technologies (5DT)'](5dt.com) for the COS 301 final year module of ['Computer Science'](https://cs.up.ac.za/) at ['University of Pretoria'](https://www.up.ac.za/). All components and subsystems were created or compiled by the Gradient Team.

Purpose: LightBot's goal is to explore the possibility to minimize the delays that are caused by traffic congestions at various intersections. The LightBot system will be used to prove a concept that the addition of a machine learning algorithm will develop a good policy for which to control the traffic lights at a given intersection and may benefit society through time-efficiency, monetarily and perhaps even reduce vehicular emissions.
