# LIGHTBOT AI ENHANCED TRAFFIC SIMULATION

This repository contains an implementation of the automatic AI enhanced traffic simulation of Lightbot. Lightbot is a software engineering project proposed by ['Fifth Dimension Technologies (5DT)'](5dt.com) for the COS 301 final year module of ['Computer Science'](https://cs.up.ac.za/) at ['University of Pretoria'](https://www.up.ac.za/). It contains a rendition of ['SUMO'](https://sumo.dlr.de/docs/index.html) with models of the traffic intersections covered by the LightBot solution as well as sumoweb3D for 3D visualization of the simulations in the web application. ['Python'](https://www.python.org/) , with the ['TraCI'](https://sumo.dlr.de/docs/TraCI.html) and ['TensorFlow'](https://www.tensorflow.org/) libraries, is used in the implementation of a Reinforcement Learning agent for adaptive traffic light control.

## Contributers

Rahul Kapoor & Jared Gratz - Reinforcement Learning Agent for Traffic Light Control

Thiveshan Pillay - Mapping of roads and vehicle routes

## Development

We use `python` with`tensorflow` to develop this portion of the system. For details regarding installing all depencences for the simulaiton, please refer to our ['Techincal Installation Manual'](https://sumo.dlr.de/docs/index.html)

# Roadmap

- [x] Initial setup of manual simulation
- [x] Extension for automatic simulation
- [x] Creation of models
- [x] Generation of vehicles and routes
- [x] Testing and Training of models
- [x] Unit testing
- [x] Continuous integration tests with Cypress
- [x] Deployment to the Amplify Console

## Why do we use Python?

Python is used quite frequently for mahine learning applications. The use of the TensorFlow library allows us to create a robust model and simplifies the training and testing process. This system offers reasonable performance when compared to alternative approaches.
